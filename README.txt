Xavier Gray's final project

This project includes the presentation given in class as well as two implementations of the same program

To run the Python program, simply use Python3 either from the commandline/bash or from the folder.

To run the Java program, please import the entire folder into a Java IDE of your choice. You can run it from there.

This program was explained in class, and thus has little documentation.
